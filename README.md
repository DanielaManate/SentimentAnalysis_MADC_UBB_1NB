***Make sure you create a folder 'SA_Final' on your Google Drive. You can upload the input data source (input_data.csv) and place this notebook in that folder.***

# Data Source
The data source we will use (input_data.csv) is a slice of the Yelp dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). We will be looking at Yelp reviews and associated ratings for restaurants, from 2017, from the city of Glendale, AZ.
